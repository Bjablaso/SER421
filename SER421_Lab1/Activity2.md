### Activity 2: Interaction Design (15%)

Each of the 3 examples is worth 5 points, 1 pt each for 1-5. You may not answer #4 and #5 with “the flow is appropriate and I would
make no changes” more than once


- A hub task flow
****
    - URL: https://my.asu.edu

    - screen:
       * Student home
       * Finance
       * Profile
       * Resource
       * Help

    - Description of the interaction pattern used

        The ASU portal uses a hub-and-spoke (hub task
         flow) interaction pattern. The main dashboard (hub) acts as the central point from which users 
         access independent task-specific pages (spokes). Each task page is self-contained, and users return to the 
         dashboard after completion or navigation.

    - User goals accomplished by the interaction pattern
        As a student user, the ASU MyASU hub allows me to register for classes, view and manage tuition 
        and finances, check grades and transcripts, update personal information, search/add/drop classes,
        and complete other administrative tasks such as reviewing holds, receiving important updates, 
        and checking graduation progress.

    - Critical analysis
        The hub task flow serves as a highly appropriate design for ASU students because it acts as
        a one-stop shop that allows students to easily find the information and resources they need throughout their online
        education journey. The dashboard is critical for accessing a variety of services, such as managing finances, 
        checking emails, updating student records, and viewing degree progress and career-related tools.
*****
    - Suggested improvements
        One suggestion to improve the ASU hub would be to add personalization features, allowing each student to 
        tailor their dashboard to highlight the tools, services, and information most relevant to their needs. T
        his could include prioritizing items based on their degree program, frequently used features, or academic 
        progress, helping students navigate their tasks more efficiently.

- A wizard or guide task flow

    - Description of the interaction pattern used
      TurboTax uses a wizard task flow where users interact with the interface step by step to complete the process
      of filing their taxes. While users can sometimes jump between screens, all required steps must be completed and 
      submitted to exit the task flow
  
    - User goals accomplished by the interaction pattern
      The goal of a wizard task flow is to guide the user through completing the overall objective of the software 
      task. In the case of TurboTax, users must complete each component of the tax application before they can submit it.
  
    - Critical analysis
      The wizard task flow is appropriate for software like TurboTax because it focuses on a clear 
       objective that requires a sequential progression to complete. Breaking the task into small, 
       logical components reduces the stress of filing taxes, making it a well-suited approach for TurboTax.

    -  Suggested improvements
        There is very little that TurboTax can do to significantly improve the user experience, as the interface 
        is already simple and largely self-explanatory. One possible enhancement might be adding more guided help 
        or smart autofill features, though I believe some of these already exist. From my experience, the need for 
        improvement is minimal.
        
- Progressive disclosure
****
    - url: https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/
    - screen:
        * Overview content
        * Tech specs (click "Tech Specs")
        * Compare models (click "Compare")
        * Buy options (click "Buy")
        * Additional product details (accordion-style "Learn more" links under features)
      
    - Description of the Interaction Pattern Used
      Apple's MacBook Air product page uses progressive disclosure to reveal increasingly detailed information 
      only when the user shows interest. For example, technical specifications, feature explanations, 
      and pricing breakdowns are hidden behind clickable text, dropdowns, or tabbed navigation. 
      This ensures the user isn't overwhelmed by details unless they choose to explore them.


    - User Goals Accomplished by the Interaction Pattern
        Apple’s goal, I believe, is to appeal to both tech-savvy users and those who are not as technically inclined. 
        The website focuses on showcasing innovation through design, emphasizing visual appeal and elegance over
        detailed specifications. Many users care more about the product’s design and its status as a symbol of 
        innovation and lifestyle, rather than its technical specs. This makes the progressive disclosure approach a
        fitting choice, as it aligns with Apple’s brand and user experience goals.

    - Critical Analysis
        Progressive disclosure fits the Apple site very well because it supports a clean, focused browsing experience
        that appeals to Apple enthusiasts, tech influencers, and new users alike. It reduces the feeling of being 
        overwhelmed and contributes to a smooth, user-friendly experience.

    - Suggested Improvements
        An improvement to the Apple website could be the addition of tooltips to help users browsing on desktop quickly 
        see key information about each product without needing to click and dive into the full product details.
